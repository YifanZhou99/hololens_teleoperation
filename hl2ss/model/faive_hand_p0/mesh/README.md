The silicone pads were added to the original link mesh manually with Meshlab.



1. load silicone pad and link mesh into meshlab
1. using the "Manipulator tool" ([YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGaNv23Xvtw)), move the silicone pads to fit the link. If the pad mesh doesn't rotate around an intuitive axis, right after loading move the pad mesh to the origin and select "Matrix: Freeze current matrix" for that object
1. "Filters" -> "Mesh Layer" -> "Flatten Visible Layers" to combine the mesh, and export to STL again
